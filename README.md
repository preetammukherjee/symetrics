# Synthetic Attack Graph Generator Tool for Comparing Related Network Security Metrics
First part of these project is about generating random attack graphs. And other part is to measure the attack graph by employing different attack graph-based security metrics viz. Attack Difficulty, Probabilistic Security, Attack Resistance, Path Length.
